#+STARTUP: showeverything

emacs.d config for enabling Rust support in emacs. It uses rust-anlyzer via rustic, lsp-mode, and lsp-ui-mode and also makes use of company, flycheck, and yasnippet. Among those features you get are

- Navigating the source code (go to to implementation, list references of symbols, outline structure of a file)
- Code completion ("intellisense")
- Code snippets
- Highlighting errors and warnings inline
- Apply code fixes and refactorings
- Automatically import definitions if necessary (such as Traits)
- Code formatting with rustfmt
- Building & running other cargo commands
